### About Me

Hey there! I'm Monisha Mekala — a curious coder, cloud enthusiast, and a firm believer that a good cup of coffee can solve most bugs ☕.

🚀 **From Backend Beginnings:** I kicked off my journey building Spring Boot microservices and wrangling legacy systems at LTIMindtree — backend became my playground, and I’ve been scaling systems ever since.

🎓 **Academic Pursuits:** Currently pursuing my Master's in Computer Science at San Francisco State University, diving deep into distributed systems and cloud computing.

🛠️ **Tech Stack:** Proficient in Go, Python, Java, and JavaScript. Experienced with Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, and a bunch of other tools that make the dev life smoother.

🌐 **Online Presence**:

When I'm not coding, you might find me exploring new cafes in San Francisco, sketching, or binge-watching sci-fi series. Let's connect and build something awesome together!
